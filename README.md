# MyFlight-Tracker
I made an app where a user is able to input their flight details and is able to keep all that information in one location. 

When traveling to multiple countries using several airlines it becomes a hassle to keep track of flight details since most airlines use their own apps.
I made an app where a user is able to input their flight details and is able to keep all that information in one location. 

This is a project that I plan on following standard agile workflow as much as I can. Once the app is back to its basic functionality I will started implementing test coverage and CI/CD. If you can help me out with this that would be great! 

## Tech/framework used

**Frontend**

- HTML/CSS/SCSS
- Typescript
- React/Redux

**Backend**

- Nodejs
- Express.js

**Built with**
- Webpack 5


## Screenshots

I will add them in the future when I get basic funcionality back online. The convertion to Typescript hindered some of it. In the meantime here's an early wireframe screen shot of it. <br>

## Features 

At the moment it has almost all CRUD functionality.
You can add cards through a modal.

### Installation

In one terminal, install dependencies and then start node server.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

In a second terminal start your frontend.

```
npm start
```

## Tests

Tests are not set up yet. However, I am planning on using Jest, Enzyme, and React Testing Library.

## Plans for the app

- [ ] Adding a solid test suite and CI/CD
- [ ] I plan on adding a database to have persistent data.
- [ ] User login screen
- [ ] User creation option
- [ ] Authentication and security measures to handle sensitive data.
- [ ] Adding a feature to add weather reports of destination location.

**Please, for any other cool ideas please feel free to shoot me an email or create an issue and will go over it!**
