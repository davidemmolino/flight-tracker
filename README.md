# MyFlight-Tracker
I made an app where a user is able to input their flight details and is able to keep all that information in one location. 

When traveling to multiple countries using several airlines it becomes a hassle to keep track of flight details since most airlines use their own apps.
I made an app where a user is able to input their flight details and is able to keep all that information in one location. 

This is a project that I plan on following standard agile workflow as much as I can. Once the app is back to its basic functionality I will started implementing test coverage and CI/CD. If you can help me out with this that would be great! 

## Tech stack

## Screenshots

I will add them in the future when I get basic functionality back online. The convertion to Typescript hindered some of it. In the meantime here's an early wireframe screen shot of it.
